Minimal web interface around the high-performance `dna_ai` engine.

## Install
```bash
cd streamlit_template
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Enter an NCBI accession or upload a FASTA file to compute sequence length and GC content. Build the `dna_ai` binary first using the instructions in the repository root.
