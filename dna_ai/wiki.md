Project Summary
The AI Coding Assistant is a cutting-edge local development tool designed to enhance developer productivity through intelligent code generation, execution, and analysis. Operating entirely offline, it allows users to generate code and receive real-time suggestions across multiple programming languages, including Python, C++, and JavaScript. This cost-effective solution leverages open-source AI models, equipping developers with a powerful assistant without relying on external APIs. The project also includes a built version for production use, ensuring a seamless experience.

Project Module Description
Core Features
Local AI Engines: Utilizes open-source models for code generation and analysis without requiring API keys.
Optimized Architecture: A single-page application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, minimizing framework overhead.
Multi-language Support: Supports code generation and execution in Python, C++, and JavaScript.
Interactive AI Chat Interface: Offers real-time coding assistance and suggestions.
File Management System: Organizes code files for easy navigation and editing.
Terminal Interface: Executes code and displays output directly within the application.
Production Build: Provides a built version of the application for deployment.
